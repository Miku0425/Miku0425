- Do you believe in justice? hehe! There should not be too many dirty things in the society. There has never been a society that is fair enough. Whether it is European and American countries or China, the money and power class is in the dominant position.What's more, a kind of idiots who "make people worry about their IQ" are emerging, and the moral atmosphere is regressing. We are in such a society. . .
